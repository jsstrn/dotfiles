## Brewfile

A Brewfile lists all your Homebrew dependencies. 

Generate a Brewfile by running the following command: 

```bash
brew bundle dump
```

If a Brewfile already exists, you can overwrite it by adding `--force`

```bash
brew bundle dump --force
```

You can search for Homebrew formulae on [https://formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh) 

## Appreciation

The popular [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io) do a lot and instead of just forking them, I wanted to write my own dotfiles.

- some install scripts were plucked from [Sahil Bajaj](https://github.com/spinningarrow/)'s [up](https://github.com/spinningarrow/up)
- some macOS preferences were picked from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/)' [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos)
- other ideas where inspired by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
