## thanks

The popular [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io) do a lot and instead of just forking them, I wanted to write my own simplified dotfiles. 

- some install scripts were plucked from [Sahil Bajaj](https://github.com/spinningarrow/)'s [up](https://github.com/spinningarrow/up)
- some macOS preferences were picked from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/)' [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos)
- other ideas where inspired by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

## todo

- add dotfiles and symlinks
	- [ ] `.gemrc`
	- [ ] `.gitconfig`
	- [ ] `.gitignore_global`
	- [ ] `.zshrc`
